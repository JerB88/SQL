#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1 How many ORDERS WERE PLACED in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2 How many of those ORDERS were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(product)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone'

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_ID=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which PRODUCT was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the PRICE?

SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

SELECT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT SUM(quantity)* price AS 'Revenue'
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(quantity)
,product
,location
,SUM(quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?


SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT product, sum(quantity), location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product
