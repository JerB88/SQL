I was putting queries together from a database using SQLiteStudio



#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT firstname, lastname, country, customerid
FROM customers
WHERE Country != "USA";

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT firstname, lastname, country, customerid
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT firstname, lastname, invoiceid, invoicedate, billingcountry
FROM customers
INNER JOIN invoices ON customers.customerid=invoices.customerid
WHERE billingcountry = 'Brazil';

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT title, firstname, lastname
FROM employees
WHERE title= 'Sales Support Agent';

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry
FROM invoices

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT firstname, lastname, invoiceid, invoicedate, billingcountry
FROM employees
JOIN customers ON customers.supportrepid=employees.employeeid
JOIN invoices ON invoices.customerid= customers.customerid;

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT invoices.total, customers.firstname, customers.lastname, customers.country, employees.firstname, employees.lastname
FROM employees
JOIN customers ON customers.supportrepid=employees.employeeid
JOIN invoices ON invoices.customerid=customers.customerid;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9 What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total) AS total_sales
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT name, invoice_items.InvoiceLineId
FROM tracks
JOIN invoice_items ON invoice_items.trackid=tracks.trackid;

#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT tracks.name, invoice_items.InvoiceLineId, artists.name
FROM invoice_items
LEFT JOIN tracks ON invoice_items.trackid=tracks.trackid
INNER JOIN albums ON albums.AlbumId=tracks.albumid
LEFT JOIN artists ON artists.artistid=albums.artistid;

#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT tracks.name as 'Track Name', albums.title AS 'Album Ttile', media_types.name AS 'Media Type', genres.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM tracks
JOIN albums ON albums.AlbumId=tracks.trackid
JOIN media_types ON media_types.MediaTypeId=tracks.MediaTypeId
JOIN genres ON genres.GenreId=tracks.GenreId;
Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT employees.firstname, employees.LastName,ROUND(SUM(Invoices.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM employees
JOIN customers ON customers.supportrepid=employees.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices ON invoices.customerid=customers.CustomerId
WHERE employees.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY employees.firstname;

#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT employees.firstname, employees.LastName,ROUND(SUM(Invoices.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'
FROM employees
JOIN customers ON customers.supportrepid=employees.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices ON invoices.customerid=customers.CustomerId
WHERE employees.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
AND invoices.invoicedate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY employees.firstname
ORDER BY (Round(SUM(invoices.total), 2)) DESC LIMIT 1;
